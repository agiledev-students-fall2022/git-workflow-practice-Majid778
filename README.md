Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important aspect of the future. This applies equally as well to Information Technology (IT) as it does many other industries that rely on it. 

AI and Machine Learning (M.L.) have taken over the traditional computing methods, changing how many industries perform and conduct their day-to-day operations. From research and manufacturing to modernizing finance and healthcare streams, leading AI has changed everything in a relatively short amount of time.

AI and related technologies have had a positive impact on the way the IT sector works. To put it simply, artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that looks to turning computers into intelligent machines that would, otherwise, not be possible without direct human intervention.By making use of computer-based training and advanced algorithms, AI and machine learning can be used to create systems capable of mimicking human behaviors, provide solutions to difficult and complicated problems, and further develop simulations, aiming to become human-level AI.

The digital transformation and adoption of AI technologies by industries has given rise to new advancements to solve and optimize many core challenges in the IT industry. Among all tech applications, AI sits at the core of development for almost every industry, with Information Technology being among the first. If the development and deployment of IT systems at large scale were next to impossible, through AIâ€™s development of advanced algorithmic functions this is now possible.
